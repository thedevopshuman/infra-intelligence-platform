# Infrastructure Intelligence Platform

> Temporary neutral project name. Product and company naming are intentionally tracked separately under [`docs/research/brand`](docs/research/brand/README.md).

Infrastructure Intelligence Platform (IIP) is an architecture-first foundation for building a vendor-neutral control plane that understands infrastructure as a resource graph and event timeline, then lets governed agents investigate and act with evidence.

This repository is at **foundation / v0.1**. It contains the living product and architecture record, versioned contracts, a small executable reference kernel, starter SDK boundaries, a plugin example, and Kubernetes packaging. It is not yet a production system.

## Start here

1. Read the [product constitution](docs/product/constitution.md).
2. Read the [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md).
3. Review the [contracts index](docs/specifications/README.md).
4. Follow the [initial roadmap](docs/roadmap/initial-roadmap.md).
5. When changing code with Codex, follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Local quick start

The reference kernel deliberately uses only the Python standard library.

```bash
make verify
make run
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/resources \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data @contracts/examples/resource.json
```

The API is a narrow vertical slice: validate a resource observation, authorize ingestion, upsert it, and emit a CloudEvents-compatible event. It exists to prove package boundaries, not to define the final storage or transport stack.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `api/` | Public protocol descriptions, starting with OpenAPI |
| `contracts/` | Machine-readable schemas and valid examples |
| `src/iip/` | Provider-neutral reference kernel and composition root |
| `sdks/` | Public Python and TypeScript client boundaries |
| `plugins/` | Plugin examples; vendor code stays outside the kernel |
| `deploy/` | Helm chart and local Kubernetes overlay |
| `docs/` | Living product, architecture, specifications, research, and roadmap |
| `scripts/` | Repository validation checks |
| `tests/` | Boundary and vertical-slice tests |

## Architectural stance

- Resource identity and event history are the system of record.
- Every agent conclusion must be traceable to evidence.
- Read, propose, approve, and execute are different authority levels.
- Vendor adapters and plugins depend on stable platform ports; the domain never depends on a vendor SDK.
- Contracts are versioned before implementations fan out.
- Tenant isolation and auditability are design inputs, not later hardening tasks.

## Current decisions and open questions

Accepted foundations live in [`docs/decisions`](docs/decisions/README.md). Open questions—graph store, durable event transport, identity provider, model runtime, and licensing—are explicit roadmap decisions, not hidden assumptions.

## Licensing

No open-source license has been selected yet. Until that decision is recorded, do not assume permission to redistribute this repository. See the [open-source and commercial boundary](docs/product/open-source-boundary.md).
